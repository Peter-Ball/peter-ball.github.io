                <h2>Collecting a Queer Archive</h2>
                <h3>Web Scraping Archive of our Own</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="article_body">
                <p>In the summer of 2019, I collected, organized, and annotated ~800,000 works of fan fiction from <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/">Archive of our Own</a>. The set contains almost every english fan fiction from 18 fandoms written between 2008 and 2018. The purpose of collecting this data was to facilitate large-scale textual analytics of an emerging writing space that radically differs in both author and character demographics from traditional literary corpuses. Digital humanities is mostly focused on small corpuses of printed books from the 20th century, with largely white male authorship and heternormative character relations. This set is derived from an active community of overwhelmingly female-identifying authors (<a href="https://centrumlumina.tumblr.com/post/63208278796/ao3-census-masterpost">source</a> 2013), and 72% of its works depict queer relationships. This affords student researchers at <a href="https://txtlab.org/">.txtlab</a> a new range of possibilities for life-affirming data science work.</p>
                <p>Building off my work in the summer, I collected another dataset that connects works to author social behaviour in service of an upcoming project by Profs. Richard So (McGill) and Aarthi Vadde (Duke) on reader response theory. <a href="https://github.com/Peter-Ball/AO3_ReaderResponse">Check it out!</a></p>
                <p>This process has taught me a lot about responsible research practices and have become very endeared towards the fanfic community along the way. It also sparked my interest in the function of queer archives throughout history, which I have written about in class. I also had to consider the privacy implications of such a collection project. As a result neither the dataset or the scraping code are public at the moment. If you are interested in collecting data from the website and would like some help getting started, please get in touch :)</p>
