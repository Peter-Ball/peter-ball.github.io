                <h2>Do News Recommender Systems Contribute to Political Polarization?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="article_body">
                <p>It has been said that the media is the fourth branch of government, and access to a free and diverse media ecosystem is essential to the function of democracy. Since the introduction of personalized news recommendations powered by machine learning systems, there has been public concern over the possibility of a "filter bubble," where readers are increasingly served news that supports pre-existing beliefs, leading to increased political polarization.</p>

                <p>As part of a graduate seminar, a classmate and I set out to measure this phenomenon. We implemented several state-of-the-art deep-learning based recommender systems, and developed a novel method for measuring their influence on user polarization. Our goals were to determine whether recommender systems polarize news readers, the degree to which each individual architecture contributes to the problem, and to start a conversation about possible solutions.</p>

                <p>Our results, which were surprising at every turn, are recorded in presentation form <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LAJivqmlsBGL915P9PFbi80abH5iSd9VlcGNhBmCsuU/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. The code we wrote, including our implementation of several deep learning models, can be found in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1o87vAgrVkx_Nsm6u-VczmOSYSytqYZkG?usp=sharing">this google colab notebook</a>.
